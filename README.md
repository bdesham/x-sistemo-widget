# README for x-sistemo widget

This is a simple Dashboard widget to convert Esperanto text between the X-system (e.g. “sxati”) and Unicode (e.g. “ŝati”). It consists of a text area and two buttons… one converts all text to the X-system and the other converts all text to Unicode.

## Notes

* The widget is very dumb about the input text.  If you happen to put in something other than Esperanto text, and it contains “cx”, “ux”, or the like, then those letter combinations will be converted to “ĉ”, “ŭ”, etc.  This might mess up web addresses, for example.
